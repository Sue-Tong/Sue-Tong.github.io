My name is Tong Su, a fourth-year undergraduate student at the University of Toronto. I was born in China and finished my secondary and high school in Singapore. My dream is to experience life in different countries. Therefore. the next step is to going to xxx (make a guess!) to continue my graduate study.

I am studying Computer Science and Statistics with a focus on Artificial Intelligence. I am interested in Computer Vision, Natural Language Processing, Machine Learning, and Software Engineering. My ultimate objective is to utilize AI's potential to significantly impact minority communities positively. 

Currently, I am working in [Northbridge](https://www.nbfc.com/) as a full-stack developer.
